Todo:

Jump to relative address (*PR @ A/R0)
40x25 monochrome text display (mode 0)

Test boot.hex program that prints "Hello World" to mode 0 screen, takes user keyboard input with an interrupt handler and prints it after hello world message

Low priority:
Custom single-pass assembler
Better differentiation of VM input files through different extensions (.rom, .flash, .drv?)
