Screen page memory map:
Upper word at FFFF determines mode of the screen, 0xFFFE contains screen opcode register, 0xFFFD contains screen status register
0 is monochrome lower-byte only 40x25 character text mode
1 is color 40x25 text mode
2 is 320x200 4bit color mode, one pixel per word, single buffer mode
3 is 320x200 256 color full 32 bit color palette mode with two buffers, one word is two pixels each color determined by palette index value, lower byte is right pixel, upper byte is left pixel

0x0000 -> 0xF9FF --- Frame buffer, single in mode 2, covers two in mode 3
0x0000 -> 0x7CFF --- Framm buffer A in mode 3
0x7D00 -> 0xF9FF --- Frame buffer B in mode 3
0xFA00 -> 0xFBFF --- 256 32 bit color palette for mode 3
